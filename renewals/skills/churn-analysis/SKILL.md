# /renewals:churn-analysis [VALIDATED]

Root cause analysis of a closed churn or contraction. Extract what happened,
why it happened, and whether it's about to happen again somewhere else.

---

## Use when
- A renewal has been confirmed lost or contracted and you need to extract root cause while the context is fresh (within 30 days)
- You have a closed churn event and want to reconstruct the signal timeline to assess whether the team had adequate time to act
- You want to scan the active book for accounts sharing the same signal pattern as a recently churned account
- You are running a batch retrospective across multiple losses (quarter-end or annual review)

## Do NOT use for
- Accounts that have not yet churned — use `/renewals:risk-assessment` for at-risk active accounts
- Real-time churn prevention or mid-renewal save strategy — this skill analyzes past events, not active ones
- Expansion or upsell signals in current accounts
- Generating a risk tier or triggering an escalation from portfolio scan output alone — scan results require a full risk-assessment before any tier is assigned

## Typical Activation
> `/renewals:churn-analysis Acme Corp` — full post-mortem on a recently closed loss
> `/renewals:churn-analysis Acme Corp --quick` — abbreviated root cause and lesson, use when processing multiple losses
> `/renewals:churn-analysis --portfolio-scan` — skip single-account analysis and scan the active book for matching signal patterns after root cause is already established

---

## Pre-flight

Read both configuration files before running any churn analysis:
1. `~/.claude/plugins/config/claude-for-customer-success/renewals/CLAUDE.md`
2. `~/.claude/plugins/config/claude-for-customer-success/company-profile.md`

If either file is missing or contains `[PLACEHOLDER]` markers in churn-signal
or escalation fields, proceed with a notice:

> "Your churn signal definitions are not configured. The analysis will use
> general SaaS churn patterns. Run `/renewals:cold-start-interview --section
> churn-signals` to configure your specific signals — this will make future
> churn analysis and portfolio scanning more accurate for your product and motion."

Fields read from config:
- Primary churn drivers (configured signals to check against)
- Competitive threats (known displacement patterns)
- Customer segments and average deal size
- Escalation matrix (to assess whether escalation was triggered at the right
  time in the timeline)
- Health score threshold configuration (to assess whether health score
  reflected the churn risk before it was confirmed)

**G-code dependency:** All G-code guardrails referenced in this skill (G1–G9) are defined in the CLAUDE.md config loaded above. If Pre-flight halts or config is missing, G-codes are undefined — do not proceed with partial config.

## Reasoning Protocol

Before generating output, apply these primers:

1. **CLASSIFY**: What type of churn analysis request is this?
   - **Signal-Rich Loss**: CRM data, call recordings, health history available. Full timeline reconstruction possible — risk is over-attributing to the loudest signal rather than the earliest.
   - **Data-Sparse Loss**: Minimal CRM history, no recordings. Depends on CSM recollection. Risk is accepting the stated close reason as root cause without corroboration.
   - **Portfolio Pattern Scan**: Root cause already established; scanning active book for matching signal patterns. Risk is false positives from single-signal matching.
   - **Batch Retrospective**: Multiple losses analyzed together (quarter-end, annual). Risk is mixing controllable and uncontrollable churn in aggregate patterns.

2. **CONSTRAINTS**: What limits the solution space?
   - G1: Health scores and churn signals are heuristics — never present as predictive certainty or frame as "this account was going to churn." Decompose into specific observable signals.
   - G2: Portfolio scan results are leads for risk assessment, not risk tiers — never assign a risk tier or trigger an escalation from scan output alone.
   - G4: Escalation assessment in the response adequacy section must reference the configured escalation matrix (owner, channel, SLA) — no generic "should have escalated sooner."
   - G5: Full churn analysis contains ARR, health data, and stakeholder details — confirm recipient authorization before distribution. Lessons section can be shared broadly when stripped of account-specific data.
   - G7: Flag data staleness — CRM >7 days, CS Platform >3 days, call data >14 days. Analyses run >60 days after the churn event get an explicit confidence downgrade.

3. **EXPERT CHECK**: What would a veteran CS leader verify first?
   - Is the root cause assignment based on the earliest signal in the timeline, or the most recent/dramatic one? Work backward from confirmation to the first crack.
   - Does the stated CRM close reason match the evidence, or is it a surface narrative masking a deeper failure (e.g., "budget cut" masking a relationship gap)?
   - Is the response adequacy assessment judged against what was visible at the time, or contaminated by hindsight? Fair assessment requires the "at the time" lens.

4. **ANTI-PATTERNS**: Common churn analysis mistakes to avoid:
   - Accepting the CRM close reason as the root cause without independent corroboration — stated reasons and actual root causes diverge frequently.
   - Assigning root cause to the last signal before churn rather than the first — recency bias is the most common analytical error in timeline reconstruction.
   - Running a portfolio scan on a single signal — require 2+ co-occurring signals plus contextual match (tenure, segment) to avoid noise that erodes trust.
   - Including force majeure losses (acquisition, closure, regulatory) in process-improvement conclusions — uncontrollable losses should not drive response process changes.
   - Framing response adequacy as individual blame rather than process diagnostics — the analysis surfaces signal coverage and escalation timing gaps, not performance assessments.
   - Generating a complete-looking timeline from sparse data without flagging gaps — visible gaps are more honest than fabricated continuity.

**After execution**, verify:
- Does the root cause assignment cite specific, named evidence from the timeline (not general observations)?
- Are all data sources timestamped and staleness-flagged per G7?
- Is the response adequacy assessment based on what was visible at the time, not hindsight?
- Are lessons actionable (specify what to do differently) rather than observational (state what went wrong)?
- Confidence: [High] if 2+ independent sources corroborate root cause / [Medium] if single-source or partial corroboration / [Low] if stated reason only — state which.

## This Skill vs. Risk Assessment

**`/renewals:risk-assessment`** — Use when an account is approaching renewal
and you need to assess churn risk in time to act. Output: risk tier, escalation
routing, save options.

**`/renewals:churn-analysis`** — Use after the account has churned or contracted.
Output: what went wrong, when the signals appeared, whether the response was
timely, lessons captured, whether the pattern exists in active accounts.

Running churn analysis on an account that hasn't churned yet is the wrong tool —
route to `/renewals:risk-assessment` instead.

---

## Mode

`--deep` (default): Full analysis — signal timeline, root cause categorization,
response adequacy assessment, lessons captured, and portfolio scan for matching
signal patterns in active accounts.

`--quick`: Abbreviated analysis — primary root cause, two-sentence lesson, and
whether a portfolio scan is warranted. Use when processing multiple losses at
once (e.g., quarter-end retrospective) and full analysis isn't needed for each.

`--portfolio-scan`: Skip the single-account analysis and run the pattern-matching
step across the active book. Use when you already have the root cause from a
prior analysis and need to identify which current accounts share it.

---

## Account identification and event data

Ask: "Which account churned or contracted? Provide the account name, the
confirmed non-renewal or contraction date, the ARR lost, and the stated reason
if captured."

If a CRM connector is available, pull:
- Closed/lost reason from the renewal opportunity
- Account ARR and close date
- Original contract start date (tenure at churn)
- CSM owner history during the account lifecycle
- Support ticket history
- Last meaningful customer contact before churn was confirmed
- Any competitor mentioned in opportunity notes

Confirm the pull:
> "[CRM]: [account name] · $[ARR lost] lost · closed [date] · tenure [N]
> months · reason captured: [yes — '[reason]' | no] · last contact: [date]"

If CRM data is unavailable:
> "Working from what you provide. Tell me: ARR, tenure, reason if known,
> and what you remember about the last 90 days of the relationship."

---

## Signal timeline reconstruction

Build the timeline of signals chronologically — when they first appeared,
when they were noticed, and when action was taken (if it was).

| Date | Signal | Domain | First noticed | Action taken |
|------|--------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| [date] | [specific signal] | [adoption / engagement / support / commercial / renewal posture] | [date first noticed] | [action / none] |

Fill the timeline from:
- CRM activity log (call dates, email dates, opportunity stage changes)
- Call recording timestamps (if connector available)
- Support ticket open/close dates
- Health score history (if CS Platform available)
- User-provided recollection

**Key questions the timeline must answer:**

1. How many days before renewal was the first signal visible?
2. How many days before renewal was the signal noticed by the CSM?
3. Was a risk-assessment run? If so, when, and what tier was assigned?
4. Was an escalation triggered? If so, when?
5. Was the escalation within the SLA configured in the escalation matrix?
6. What was the last action taken before churn was confirmed — and was it
   the right action?

> ⚠️ Timeline lag is a key diagnostic. If the first signal appeared 90 days
> before renewal and action wasn't taken until day 20, the system didn't
> fail — the process did. If the signal appeared at day 20 and wasn't visible
> earlier, that's a signal-coverage gap. These have different fixes.

## Root cause categorization

Assign a primary root cause and up to two contributing factors. Use the
configured primary churn drivers where available; otherwise use the standard
taxonomy below.

### Standard root cause taxonomy

**Adoption failure**
The product was deployed but never successfully integrated into the customer's
workflow. Characterized by low active user counts, core features never
activated, and champion feedback that value wasn't realized.

*Sub-types:* Onboarding gap (never properly implemented) / usage plateau
(adopted initially, then declined) / champion-dependent (single user drove
adoption; their departure ended it)

**Relationship gap**
The relationship with the account was too thin or too narrow to survive normal
business turbulence. Characterized by single-threaded relationships, executive
sponsor changes with no backup relationship, or a champion who left without
a handoff.

*Sub-types:* Champion departure without replacement / executive sponsor
change without re-engagement / CSM transition without proper handoff

**Commercial misalignment**
The price-to-value equation failed — either the price increased without
corresponding value realization, or the account's budget was reduced and
the product wasn't protected.

*Sub-types:* Price increase triggered departure / budget cut without save
conversation / contract terms that were never satisfactory

**Product gap**
The product didn't do what the customer needed — either a specific feature
gap, a reliability or performance issue, or a product direction that moved
away from the customer's use case.

*Sub-types:* Feature gap (missing capability) / reliability/performance
issue / roadmap misalignment / integration failure

**Competitive displacement**
A competitor won the account. The loss may have been driven by product gaps,
pricing, or relationship factors — but a competitor captured the replacement.

*Sub-types:* Direct feature replacement / pricing undercut / internal-build
decision / point solution replacing platform

**External / force majeure**
The customer's business changed in a way unrelated to product or relationship
quality: acquisition, company closure, budget elimination, regulatory change,
or team elimination.

---

### Root cause assignment format

> **Primary root cause:** [Category] — [Sub-type]
> **Contributing factors:** [Factor 1] / [Factor 2 if applicable]
>
> **Evidence:** [2–3 specific signals from the timeline that support this
> assignment — not general observations, specific data points]

Do not assign a root cause without evidence. If the evidence is insufficient,
say so:
> "Root cause cannot be reliably determined — [specific data point] is missing.
> The most likely candidate is [category] based on [available evidence], but
> this should be treated as [Low Confidence] until [missing data] is obtained."

---

## Response adequacy assessment

Evaluate whether the CS team's response was appropriate given what was visible.
This is a diagnostic, not a blame assignment.

| Criterion | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Signal appeared early enough to act | [Yes — N days before renewal / No — inside [N] days] | |
| Signal was noticed within reasonable time | [Yes / No — N day lag] | |
| Risk assessment was run | [Yes — [date] / No] | |
| Risk tier was accurate | [Yes / No — was [tier], should have been [tier]] | |
| Escalation was triggered | [Yes — [date] / No] | |
| Escalation was within SLA | [Yes / No — SLA was [N] days, triggered at [N] days] | |
| Save strategy was deployed | [Yes — [strategy] / No] | |
| Save strategy was appropriate | [Yes / No — should have been [alternative]] | |

**Summary:**
> "[Account name] churned due to [root cause]. The first signal appeared [N]
> days before renewal. [Action was taken within SLA / action was delayed by
> N days / no escalation was triggered]. The save strategy [was appropriate /
> was insufficient because [reason] / was not deployed]."

This assessment is internal. It surfaces process gaps — signal coverage, SLA
compliance, save strategy selection — that can be improved for future accounts.

---

## Lessons captured

Three to five lessons, each tied to a specific observation from this account.
A lesson must be actionable — it must describe what to do differently, not just
what went wrong.

**Lesson format:**

> **Lesson [N]:** [Label]
> **Observation:** [Specific thing that happened or didn't happen in this account]
> **Root connection:** [How this observation connects to the root cause]
> **Action change:** [What the team should do differently for this class of account]
> **Applicable to:** [Signal type / account segment / tenure stage / CS motion]

> ⚠️ Lessons are not performance notes. They describe process improvements,
> signal gaps, and response timing improvements — not assessments of individual
> CSM performance. If a lesson reveals a systemic gap (e.g., "no escalation
> protocol exists for [signal type]"), flag it for Head of CS review.

---

## Portfolio pattern scan

After completing the single-account analysis, scan the active book for accounts
that share the primary root cause signal pattern.

Ask: "Do you want me to scan your active renewal book for accounts showing
similar signals? This requires either CRM connector access or a list of your
current accounts."

If CRM is available, check active accounts for:
- The same signal combination that drove this churn
- Accounts at a similar tenure stage (churn risk often clusters by tenure)
- Accounts in the same segment or vertical as the churned account
- Accounts with the same root cause sub-type (e.g., single-threaded champion
  relationship, low feature adoption, budget freeze mentioned)

**Portfolio scan output:**

| Active account | ARR | Renewal date | Matching signals | Recommended action |
|---------------|-----|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| [name] | $[ARR] | [date] | [1-2 signals] | `/renewals:risk-assessment` / monitor / no action |

> ⚠️ Portfolio scan results are leads for risk assessment — not risk tiers.
> An active account with a similar signal pattern requires a full
> `/renewals:risk-assessment` before a risk tier is assigned. Do not use
> portfolio scan output as a substitute for individual account assessment.

If no accounts match:
> "No active accounts show the primary signal pattern from this loss. Either
> the pattern is isolated to this account's circumstances, or the signals
> aren't captured in the current CRM data. Verify data coverage before
> concluding the book is clean."

## Security & Permissions

```
network:        none — no direct HTTP calls; CRM data surfaces via MCP connector, not filesystem reads by this skill
read_scope:     ~/.claude/plugins/config/claude-for-customer-success/renewals/CLAUDE.md and
                ~/.claude/plugins/config/claude-for-customer-success/company-profile.md only
write_scope:    none — all analysis output to conversation; no file writes
subprocess:     none
dynamic_code:   none — no eval, no exec, no runtime code execution
```

This skill reads two plugin config files at session start (Pre-flight) and produces all output directly in the conversation. It does not write to the filesystem, make network calls, or access any account data directly — CRM and account data are provided by the operator through the MCP connector or as manual input in the session.

---

## Trust & Verification

**Account data handling:**
All account data (ARR, health scores, signal timelines, CRM notes) is provided through operator-controlled MCP connectors or direct user input. This skill does not read account data from the filesystem and cannot access CRM systems independently of the session context.

**Free-text field handling:**
`churn_context`, `account_name`, and all manual inputs are treated as display data. They are not executed, evaluated, or used to derive file paths or system behavior.

**Root cause confidence labeling:**
All inferred root cause assignments carry explicit confidence signals (`[High Confidence]`, `[Moderate]`, `[Low Confidence]`). The Reviewer note surface forces explicit sourcing declarations before any output leaves the session.

**Portfolio scan scope:**
Portfolio scan output (`--portfolio-scan`) flags pattern matches for CSM review — it does not automatically trigger risk escalations, modify account records, or write any data. All flagged accounts require a full `/renewals:risk-assessment` before any tier is assigned.

**Config file integrity:**
Pre-flight reads config files at fixed paths. If either config file is absent or malformed, the skill surfaces the gap and asks for manual input rather than proceeding with defaults. Config content is used for display context only — it does not affect analysis logic or output structure.

---

## Guardrails

**Analysis, not attribution.** Churn analysis identifies process gaps and
signal patterns — it does not assess or imply individual performance. Lessons
surface what to do differently, not who failed. If a lesson surfaces a systemic
gap, route it to Head of CS — not into a performance conversation.

**Root cause requires evidence.** Do not assign a root cause category without
specific, named evidence from the account timeline. An inferred root cause must
be labeled `[Low Confidence]` and noted as requiring verification.

**Portfolio scan is a lead generator, not a risk tier.** Any active account
surfaced by the portfolio scan requires a full `/renewals:risk-assessment`
before a risk tier is assigned or an escalation is triggered.

**Timing lag is diagnostic data.** The gap between when a signal first appeared
and when it was noticed is process intelligence — not fault assignment. Surface
it honestly; use it to improve signal coverage and escalation SLAs.

**Confidentiality.** Churn analysis contains account ARR, relationship health,
and stakeholder details. Lessons can be shared broadly (stripped of account-
specific data); the full analysis requires recipient authorization.

**Distinguish controllable from uncontrollable.** External/force majeure churn
(acquisition, company closure, regulatory change) is not a process failure. Flag
it as uncontrollable and confirm that the loss shouldn't drive process changes
that address a problem the team couldn't have solved. Don't over-index on
uncontrollable losses when designing prevention systems.

**Retrospective window.** The analysis is most accurate within 30 days of
the churn event — context decays quickly. Flag analyses run more than 60 days
after close:
> "⚠️ This analysis is being run [N] days after the churn event. Recollections
> may be incomplete and CRM data may have been modified. Treat the timeline
> reconstruction as [Moderate] confidence unless corroborated by call recordings
> or timestamped CRM entries."

## FM classification addendum (additive, v1.1.0)

[PROPOSED addendum, 2026-09-02. The skill body above remains VALIDATED as shipped; this
section adds an output field, changes no existing behavior.]

When a root cause is assigned, ALSO emit the suite-standard failure-mode class so churn
intelligence aggregates with the Value Registry and the acquisition drift dashboard:

| FM class | Meaning | Typical root-cause mapping |
|---|---|---|
| FM-A | Healthy churn (M&A, shutdown, genuine strategic shift; no process failure) | uncontrollable-external |
| FM-B | Delivery / CS process failure (value deliverable but not delivered or not recognized) | onboarding failure, adoption stall, relationship neglect |
| FM-C | Sales over-commitment (promises beyond sales-eligible catalog tiers) | expectation mismatch, capability gap vs. promise |
| FM-D | Discovery failure (the problem or economics were never validated pre-sale) | wrong-fit acquisition, no validated Why Change / Why Now |

Where a `/vbs:sale-quality-review` record exists for the account's original deal, compare its
predicted FM exposure with this classification and state match or divergence: matches validate
the pre-close gate; divergences are calibration input. Deliver the FM class in the analysis
output and in any digest feeding `churn-signal-scanner`, so FM-C/FM-D share is computable
portfolio-wide (rising share is the earliest quantitative signal that sellability bias has
re-entered acquisition).
